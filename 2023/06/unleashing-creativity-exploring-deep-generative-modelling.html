<p><strong><em>Why Care About Generative Models?</em></strong> Generative models hold tremendous potential in various domains, including art, music, image synthesis, and data augmentation. By learning the underlying structure of a dataset, generative models can produce new samples that capture the essence of the original data distribution. This ability to generate novel and diverse content has significant implications for creative applications, data augmentation, and understanding complex data patterns.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Latent Variable Models:</strong> Latent variable models form the foundation of generative modeling. These models assume the existence of hidden variables that capture the underlying structure of the data. By learning the relationship between the observed and latent variables, generative models can generate new samples by sampling from the latent space.</p>

<p><strong>Autoencoders:</strong> Autoencoders are a class of neural networks used for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction. They consist of an encoder that maps the input data to a latent space and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from the latent representation. Autoencoders provide a framework for generative modelling by leveraging the latent space for sampling and generating new data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Variational Autoencoders:</strong> Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful extension of autoencoders that incorporate probabilistic modelling. VAEs learn the latent distribution of the data and generate new samples by sampling from this learned distribution. The reparameterization trick allows efficient training and sampling from the latent space, enabling VAEs to generate diverse and realistic data.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Priors on the Latent Distribution:</strong> In VAEs, the choice of prior distribution on the latent space plays a crucial role in shaping the generated samples. By carefully selecting and designing the prior, we can influence the properties of the generated data, such as diversity, continuity, or specific attributes. Priors provide control over the generative process, allowing us to generate samples with desired characteristics.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Latent Perturbation and Disentanglement:</strong> One remarkable property of VAEs is the ability to manipulate the latent space to explore different variations of the generated data. By perturbing the latent variables, we can generate diverse samples while maintaining certain aspects of the original data. Disentangled representations allow us to isolate and control specific attributes, leading to more interpretable and controllable generative models.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Debiasing with VAEs:</strong> VAEs can be employed to address biases present in the training data. By modifying the training objective to account for fairness and equity, VAEs can generate debiased samples that mitigate unfairness and discrimination. This aspect of VAEs holds promise in creating fair and ethical AI systems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks:</strong> Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) provide an alternative approach to generative modeling by training two competing networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator aims to produce samples that resemble the real data, while the discriminator aims to distinguish between real and generated samples. GANs have achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images and realistic data across various domains.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Intuitions Behind GANs:</strong> Understanding the dynamics of GANs is crucial to comprehend their inner workings. We explore the adversarial training process, the generator's quest for fooling the discriminator, and the discriminator's quest for accurate classification. This interplay between the generator and discriminator leads to the generation of increasingly realistic samples.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Training GANs:</strong> Training GANs can be challenging due to the delicate balance between the generator and discriminator. We delve into training techniques such as mini-batch discrimination, feature matching, and the importance of optimization algorithms to stabilize the training process and improve the quality of generated samples.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>GANs: Recent Advances:</strong> GANs have witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years. We discuss cutting-edge techniques, including conditional GANs, which generate samples conditioned on specific labels or attributes. Additionally, we explore the concept of CycleGAN, a powerful framework for unpaired image translation that enables the transformation of images from one domain to another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Summary of VAEs and GANs:</strong> In summary, Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks represent two prominent approaches in deep generative modelling. VAEs leverage latent variables and probabilistic modelling to generate diverse data while maintaining control and interpretability. GANs, on the other hand, utilize adversarial training to generate realistic samples by capturing the distribution of the real data. Both VAEs and GANs have revolutionized the field of generative modelling and paved the way for creative AI applications.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Diffusion Model Sneak Peek:</strong> As a tantalizing glimpse into the future, we introduce the Diffusion Model, an exciting area of research that holds promise for generating high-quality samples and providing fine-grained control over the generative process. We explore the foundations and potential of this emerging field, opening doors to new frontiers in deep generative modelling.</p>

<p>In conclusion, deep generative modelling is a captivating field that allows machines to unleash their creative potential. Through VAEs, GANs, and emerging techniques like the Diffusion Model, we can generate diverse, realistic, and controllable data. The impact of generative models spans across numerous domains, including art, entertainment, data augmentation, and beyond. As technology advances, we can expect even more exciting breakthroughs in deep generative modeling, opening up new possibilities for human-AI collaboration and innovation.</p>
