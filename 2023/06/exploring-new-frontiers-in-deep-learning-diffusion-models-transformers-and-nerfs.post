<p><strong>Diffusion Models:</strong> Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful framework for generative modelling and data synthesis. Unlike traditional generative models, diffusion models directly model the data diffusion process, allowing for efficient sampling and synthesis. We explore the mathematical foundations, training procedures, and applications of diffusion models, including image synthesis, data augmentation, and unsupervised learning tasks.</p>
