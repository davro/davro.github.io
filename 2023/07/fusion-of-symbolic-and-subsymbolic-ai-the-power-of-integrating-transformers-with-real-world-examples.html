	    <h1>Fusion of Symbolic and Subsymbolic AI: The Power of Integrating Transformers with Real-world Examples</h1>

            <!-- Post Content -->
	    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has witnessed remarkable progress through two main approaches: symbolic AI, characterised by explicit knowledge representation using rules and logic, and subsymbolic AI, represented by data-driven methods like neural networks. The fusion of these two paradigms holds the promise of creating more intelligent, interpretable, and versatile AI systems. In this article, we delve into the integration of Transformers, a cutting-edge subsymbolic AI architecture, with symbolic AI techniques, exploring real-world examples and code snippets to illustrate the potential of this fusion.</p>

<p><em><strong>The Duality of Symbolic and Subsymbolic AI</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Symbolic AI relies on explicit rules and logical reasoning, enabling interpretable decision-making. However, it faces challenges in handling uncertainty and learning from vast unstructured data. On the other hand, subsymbolic AI, such as Transformers, excels in learning patterns from data but may lack the explainability and reasoning capabilities of symbolic approaches.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>Transformers: A Dominant Subsymbolic AI Paradigm</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Transformers have risen to prominence as a leading subsymbolic AI architecture, particularly in natural language processing and beyond. The Transformer's self-attention mechanism enables parallel processing and capturing long-range dependencies, making it ideal for sequential data analysis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><em><strong>Example 1: Knowledge Graph Transformers</strong></em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One promising integration of Transformers with symbolic AI is the concept of Knowledge Graph Transformers. Knowledge graphs offer structured representations of information in the form of nodes and edges, representing entities and their relationships. By combining Transformers with knowledge graph embeddings, we can create AI models capable of reasoning over explicit knowledge while leveraging subsymbolic learning capabilities.</p>
