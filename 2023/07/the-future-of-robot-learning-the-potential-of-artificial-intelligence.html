<p><strong>The Current State of Robot Learning</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Robot learning is rooted in the concept of AI-enabled robots capable of autonomously acquiring knowledge and skills through experience. Presently, we witness the application of robot learning in diverse domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, logistics, and more. These robots can perform complex tasks with precision, consistency, and efficiency.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Current robot learning approaches predominantly involve supervised and reinforcement learning methods. Supervised learning entails training robots using labelled datasets, while reinforcement learning utilises a system of rewards and penalties to optimise actions and decisions. Despite their achievements, these methods have their limitations, such as extensive data requirements, fine-tuning, and lack of generalization in complex environments.</p>
