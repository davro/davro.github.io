What do you think of this 

The article will expand to be a series of around 7 articles, with the first detailing the setting up of python and CUDA, creating the CNN and optimising the model using a hyperparameter grid search technique, testing learning rates, momentum, batch sizes, and number of epochs to find optimal values that improve performance, aiming for an initial network accuracy of around 80%+ on 10k test images. 

Then the following articles will focus on these 6 steps to potentially improve the performance of the model:

Model Architecture: Consider modifying the architecture of the CNN, increasing the depth of the network, adding dropout layers for regularisation, batch normalisation layers.

Data Augmentation: artificially increase the size of the training dataset. random rotations, translations, flips, and changes in brightness/contrast.

Learning Rate Scheduling: By reducing the learning rate during training.

Regularisation: Employ techniques like weight decay or dropout to prevent over fitting on the training data.

Advanced Architectures: Investigate using more advanced CNN architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, or Inception, which may provide better performance.

Advanced Training Techniques: Transfer learning, ensembling multiple models.
